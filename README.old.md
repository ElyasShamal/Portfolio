 Welcome to my portfolio website! I've designed this site to showcase my skills and projects. One of the unique features of this portfolio
 is a theme switcher that allows you to toggle between a light and dark theme. This feature provides a personalized viewing experience, and 
 it's just a click away. In the top-right corner of the website, you'll find a switch. Click on it to change the theme. The dark theme is
 perfect for a sleek and stylish look, while the light theme offers a clean and bright appearance. Your theme preference will be remembered,
 in local storage. This means that your chosen theme will persist even if you close the website and return later. Here's how it
 works: - When you switch to your preferred theme, the choice is stored in the browser's local storage. - The next time you visit, the
 website will automatically load with your chosen theme. - You can change your theme preference at any time by clicking the switch. Feel           
 free to explore my projects, skills, and other sections to get to know me better. If you have any questions or would like to reach out, don't
 hesitate to use the contact button.   
 Thank you
